# The Deep Dive Into CNN -SOC 21'

#### This project involves understanding the fundamental concepts & different algorithms to analyze the different architectures of Convolutional Neural Networks. And implementation of these architectures in Python. 

## 1
#### This included learning the basics of Neural Networks and Deep Learning. By completing the two Coursera courses [Neural Network and Deep Learning](https://github.com/vtanmay3103/Deep-dive-into-CNN--SOC/tree/main/Neural%20Network%20and%20Deep%20Learning) and [Improving the Neural Network](https://github.com/vtanmay3103/Deep-dive-into-CNN--SOC/tree/main/Improving%20neural%20network)

## 2
#### After getting the some basic understanding of neural networks, now for implementing the neural nets Python has many libaries like Keras, Pytorch, etc.
#### In this project we learned the [Pytorch](https://github.com/vtanmay3103/Deep-dive-into-CNN--SOC/tree/main/Pytorch) library for implementing the neural networks. 

## 3
#### This week started with learning the fundamental concepts of CNN .
#### After that implementing the CNN from scratch using Pytorch on a kaggle challenge [Digit Recognizer](https://github.com/vtanmay3103/Deep-dive-into-CNN--SOC/blob/main/CNN/Digit%20recognizer%20CNN%20model.ipynb) 
#### Reading the research papers of different architectures of CNN - AlexNet, VggNet, ResNet, GoogleNet

## 4
#### Implementing the [AlexNet architecture](https://github.com/vtanmay3103/Deep-dive-into-CNN--SOC/blob/main/CNN/Alexnet_Fashion_MNIST.ipynb) from scratch on the dataset Fashion MNIST 
#### Implementing and understanding the concept of Transfer Learning 
#### Implementing the transfer Learning on different architectures - [vgg11Net](https://github.com/vtanmay3103/Deep-dive-into-CNN--SOC/blob/main/CNN/Pretrained_CNN_vgg11.ipynb), [res34Net](https://github.com/vtanmay3103/Deep-dive-into-CNN--SOC/blob/main/CNN/Pretrained_CNN_resnet34.ipynb), [googleNet](https://github.com/vtanmay3103/Deep-dive-into-CNN--SOC/blob/main/CNN/Pretrained_CNN_googlenet.ipynb)
